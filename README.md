This plot shows the classifer weights for a number of factors that were used to rank how
ethical or just a company is.

The weights are used for a logistic regression classifier, which was able to separate 
locations within the lowest quartile of income inequalities from locations within the
highest quartile of income inequality with a 57% accuracy.

The highest weighted factor is how well a company treats its employees, which interestingly
enough is associated with greater amounts of income inequality in a region.

On the other hand, more intuitively, more ethical employee pay from companies is associated
with lower amounts of income inequality in a regon.

It's interesting that these two factors, which are well-correlated with each other, should
be associated with opposite directions with regards to classifying income inequality.
